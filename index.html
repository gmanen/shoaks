    <h2>Why shoak?</h2>
    <p>
        Initially, the project was just a flocking simulation based on Craig Reynolds' "boid" algorithm. When I
        introduced the concept of predators, I had to name them though. I went for the shark/fish analogy and named them
        by deriving their name the same way the word boid would be derived from the word bird. Shoak and foish are to
        shark and fish what boid is to bird.
    </p>
    <h2>How does it work?</h2>
    <p>
        At the top, you can see a top-down view of an environment where a simulation of shoaks (the red-ish circles) and
        a school of foish (the blue-ish triangles) evolve. Below that are representations of the first person point of
        view of the best alive shoak and best alive foish.
    </p>
    <p>
        The shoaks and foishes are moved around by a bunch of different forces, one of them an AI. Both are subjected to
        a bounce force when they get too close to a wall. That force propels them in the opposite direction from the
        wall, which keeps them within the boundaries.<br>
        The foishes are affected by three more forces described by the boid algorithm: alignment, cohesion, and
        separation. These forces induce the schooling behaviour they exhibit.<br>
        Both the shoaks and the foishes are driven by an AI - their brain. The brain is a simple neural network,
        interconnected layers of neurons. The neural network is fed numerical values as input and outputs two numerical
        values. The output describes the direction it wants to orient its organism and how much it wants to move in that
        direction. That information describes a steering vector resulting in another force that is applied to the
        creatures.
    </p>
    <p>
        The input for the neural networks is the sight of the shoak / foish, which is calculated using a <a
            target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_casting">raycasting algorithm</a>. Each creature
        casts a number of rays determined by the field of vision and the resolution parameters. Those rays are used to
        detect collisions with the environment. Each ray adds a value between 0 and 1 to the input of the neural
        network. Far away objects give a value closer to 0, close objects a value closer to 1.<br>
        The raycasting is also used to render the POV scenes which are a 3d simulation of what the shoaks and foishes
        see.<br>
        At the moment, the shoaks can only see foishes, and foishes can only see shoaks. They don't see in colour (the
        POV scenes are showing colours only for your benefit). Colour vision would require a more advanced neural
        network.<br>
        The shoaks have an additional input, a value between 0 and 1 which represents their hunger (how far they are
        from their maximum mass).<br>
        The foishes only call upon their neural network when they see a shoak. This is to avoid the neural network
        taking over the flocking algorithm. It creates that sort of panic behaviour when the foish sees a shoak: it
        turns around until it can't see the shoak anymore and then returns to business as usual.
    </p>
    <p>
        Both the shoaks and the foishes have a mass. The shoaks lose mass every frame and have to eat the foishes to
        gain mass. If a shoak's mass goes down to 0, it dies. The mass is represented visually by the size of the shoaks
        / foishes. The more massive shoaks are, the easier it is for them to eat foishes (they have a longer eating
        range), but the slower they move. The same goes for the foishes; the smaller, less massive ones are faster (and
        are not as nutritious for the shoak).
    </p>
    <p>
        The shoaks and foishes learn via a genetic evolution algorithm. An initial population spawns when loading the
        page (or when changing parameters). At that time, the neural networks are initialized randomly. They evolve
        primarily through mutation when reproduction occurs.<br>
        Reproduction happens in two different ways:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>At random every frame if the population isn't at its maximum size.</li>
        <li>If all individuals of a population are dead, a new generation is born from the previous generation.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The individuals are selected for reproduction based on their fitness scores. A higher fitness score means a
        higher chance of being selected.<br>
        For the soaks, the fitness score depends on how much useful mass they gained during their life. Every time they
        eat a fish, their score is only incremented if they were not already at their maximum mass beforehand.<br>
        For the foishes, the fitness score is the number of frames they stayed alive.
    </p>
    <p>
        There are two kinds of reproduction: sexual and asexual. There's a fifty-fifty chance for each to apply for
        every reproduction event.<br>
        In the case of asexual reproduction, an individual is selected to clone itself. In the case of sexual
        reproduction, two individuals are selected. Their brains are merged into that of their child.<br>
        The merge happens on a neuron by neuron basis. For each neuron, a coin is tossed to decide which parent passes
        on their gene: the neuron value and connection weights with all neurons of the preceding layers.
    </p>
    <p>
        Before integrating the population, the child's neural network undergoes mutation.<br>
        The mutation algorithm works neuron by neuron. For each neuron, there is a chance a mutation occurs. If it does,
        all the connection weights between it and the neurons from the previous layers are incremented with a random
        number.

    <h2>Debug mode</h2>
    <p>
        In debug mode, there is only one shoak, and 5 foishes, to limit somewhat the amount of information
        displayed.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            The boxes with a number in them are my implementation of a
            <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadtree">quadtree algorithm</a>.
            It's an algorithm used to optimize spacial search. The boxes are the subdivisions of space. The number
            displayed at the center of each box shows the number of items it contains.
        </li>
        <li>
            Blue lines indicate the direction toward the shoak / foishes are facing right now, and red lines the
            direction chosen by the neural network.
        </li>
        <li>The white circles are the sight radius of the shoak / foishes.</li>
        <li>The white lines are the rays used for vision.</li>
        <li>Small red circles are drawn where a ray collides with something.</li>
        <li>A bunch of information about selection and reproduction is displayed in the console.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Statistics</h2>
    <p>
        At the moment, the only statistics I display are graphs of the outputs of the neural network for the shoaks.
        This is because a lot of the time, the shoaks choose to spin around, meaning their neural network always spits
        out the same value. The graphs are used as a debug of sorts, showing how the output of the neural network
        fluctuates. You can see that usually, shoaks with high fitness have much more fluctuation in their output, which
        is what I expected to see.
    </p>
    <h2>Going forward</h2>
    <p>There is still a lot to do with this mini project, including</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Add more statistics.</li>
        <li>Increase the size of the environment, depending on the number of shoaks.</li>
        <li>Try and incentivize the shoaks to work together</li>
        <li>Add currents forcing movement on the shoaks and foishes</li>
        <li>Add obstacles in the environment, providing foishes a way to maybe hide from the shoaks</li>
        <li>
            Currently, the shoaks have no memory; all decisions taken by the neural net are based on the information
            gathered from the current frame only. Give the shoaks memory would maybe allow them to see patterns in the
            foish movements
        </li>
        <li>Go 3D</li>
    </ul>

        This project is based on the excellent videos of Daniel Shiffman and his youtube channel

        out.

        The flocking algorithm is based on Craig Reynolds "<a target="_blank" href="https://www.red3d.com/cwr/boids/">boids</a>"
        algorithm.

    <p>
        Some optimizations for the mutation algorithm were made thanks to a paper by David Montana on neural network
        weight selection using a genetic algorithm found
